# TO DO list for TOP

[Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

Key Learnings:
- Webpack importing + exporting modules. 
- Deeper understanding and practise with code organization
- localStorage web API (!)

Reminders:
- Generating Frontend from array data.
- .splice(index, 1) not only removes the target item from an array, it also returns the item in a new array. .splice(index, 1)[0] grabs that entry, not the whole array. 
- Handy keyboard event shortcuts, and e.preventDefault().
